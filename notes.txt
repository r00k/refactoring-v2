Dependency injection
  isn't exemplary, it's real
  isn't rails, so there's some small weirdness
  open PurchasesController
  where does km_http_client come from?
  benefits
    injecting this dependency makes testing easier
      don't need to stub out KM-related methods - good for integration
  costs
    indirection
      class variables and cattr_* are confusing
    hides implicit knowledge
  BEGIN
    in purchases_controller, create local kissmetrics_http_client factory
