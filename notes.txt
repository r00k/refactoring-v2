  I'll alternate pronunciation to troll everybody
  Define it
  Show sneaky violation
  It's really about DRY
    Structural vs Data
  The class is coupled to the current structure of the app
  I'd rather it be coupled just to the contract of its parameter
  You can ignore the definition though and focus on duplication
    We're allowing structural duplication in client code
    But also in specs
  Most say they *usually* follow it
    Isn't that good enough?
      No
        Beware of going back to fix things up
        You can't "just duplicate once" 
          Not on diff

      Caring about duplication trough
  Tweet about stub_chain
  Objections
    chains using same type are okay
    I'll have all these boilerplate methods!
      delegate macro
      also, why is what you need so far from your starting object?
  How to NOT DRY up the problem:
    let_user_presenter_spec.rb
      problems
        you've STILL encoded the structure of the app in the test
        mystery guest causes obscurity - exercise refers to actors not in setup
        fragile tests from complicated fixture
          example: a test called "returns a default when no parent company exists"
        slow tests due to extra data
        violates OCP
  How you SHOULD DRY up the problem:
    call @user.company_name (_ not .)
    fix test
    call @user.parent_company_name (_ not .)
    consider extracting factory to stub user
      better than let since it's more general and reusable

Dependency injection
  isn't exemplary, it's real
  isn't rails, so there's some small weirdness
  open PurchasesController
  where does km_http_client come from?
  benefits
    injecting this dependency makes testing easier
      can use a fake
      don't need to stub out KM-related methods
  costs
    indirection
      class variables and cattr_* are confusing
    divergent change
    hides implicit knowledge
  BEGIN
    open up kissmetrics_client_factory.rb and spec
    add first test for fake factory in test mode
    talk about sliming
    add test for non-test-mode, don't use fancy block
    refactor to block with ensure
    remove code from ApplicationController
    fixup tests
  benefits of new code
    still injecting dependency
    implicit is now implicitly captured
    indirection is lowered

View specs vs integration specs
  Side note: using pure mocks in views

Iceberg classes
  Listen to the tests
